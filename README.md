Aparecida Nutritionist is a project developed during the course "JavaScript: Programming in the language of the web" at alura, where we built the Aparecida Nutritionist website to calculate the BMI (Body mass index) of patients. In it we inform the name, weight, height and the body fat percentage of the patients and the website calculates the BMI and saves the data in the browser's Storage.
